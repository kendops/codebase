****Cloud Engineering Course****

It’s a bit technical, which is why the class is designed to
be highly engaging and interactive, making it both enjoyable and easy to
follow!

· We start with the theory (basic) and then:

· Demonstrate the practical application.

**Similarly, :**

• We’ll first show you how to do it manually, followed by

• Automation, where you’ll write the code and use it to deploy.

The training dives deep into mastering cloud services,
leveraging Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to automate and streamline the
deployment and management of these services.

******Topics covered: ******

1. Networking
2. Linux
3. Git - version control tool
4. AWS
5. Packer
6. Terraform
7. Ansible

****Networking**** is a foundational component of IT, enabling communication, connection, and resource sharing across systems.

• Basic networking and cloud networking concepts

• Network isolation and segmentation

• Creating and securing custom networks in cloud environments like AWS

• Leveraging industry services such as AWS VPC, AWS Transit Gateway, AWS Network Firewall, and advanced networking solutions ****Linux**** is an operating system that let you run application and software programs.

• We cover essential Linux commands every DevOps professional should know, helping you navigate the operating system with ease. Since everything ties back to Linux, you’ll master the basics.

****AWS**-** Amazon Web Service is one of the most preferred cloud platforms that lets you virtualize IT infrastructure such server, storage, network, application and database. And so on.

******We cover top-20 AWS services like: ******

1. EC2 - Linux installation
2. Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
3. Security Groups
4. VPC (Subnets, Internet Gateway, Route Tables,
   NAT, Network Access Control Lists [NACLs])
5. VPC peering
6. Transit Gateway
7. Elastic IP Address (EIP)
8. IAM (users, roles, groups, and policies)
9. Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
10. Route53
11. AutoScaling
12. DynamoDB
13. RDS
14. S3
15. EBS
16. CloudWatch
17. CloudFront
18. SNS
19. Lambda
20. CloudTrail
21. Elastic Kubernetes Services (EKS)

****Terraform**** - is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that automates the provisioning and management of cloud and on-premises infrastructure. Terraform supports multiple cloud providers: AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, VMware and many more. **Terraform** is versatile, and efficient tool for automating cloud infrastructure.

• You don’t need to have coding background

• Terraform uses plain and simple human readable language

****Packer**** We use packer create Amazon Machine Image
AMI. Image such as operating system like Linux, windows and docker. We
create AMI so that you can apply certain security compliance and framework to
make sure your underlining OS is secure enough to prevent hacker from breaking
into your OS.

****Ansible**** is a configuration management tool used
to automate the deployment of routine tasks.

**Examples include:**

1. Changing passwords
2. Installing applications
3. Setting up databases
4. Making concurrent changes to existing systems, and more.
5. Ansible is highly efficient and user-friendly for performing these tasks.

****Git**** is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in code or files, enabling multiple developers to collaborate effectively. Version Control is a system that records changes to files over time, allowing you to manage, revert, or merge changes.

****Why Git?:****

• Facilitate collaboration in development projects.

• Maintain a history of changes for easy tracking  and debugging.

• Ensure smooth code integration from multiple developers.

• Prevent conflicts and data loss.

****Course Structure****

————————————

This is a hands-on course:

• You will actively perform tasks and observe how things work.

• If you encounter errors, we will pause, guide you through resolving the issue, and then proceed.

• We focus on real-life, scenario-based projects, emphasizing both manual execution and automation techniques. Interactive session. Discussion and questions – QA

• We begin with the theory (basic) and then:

• Demonstrate the practical application.

****Similarly, **:**

• We’ll first show you how to do it manually, followed by

• Automation, where you’ll write the code and use it to deploy.
